"Displayed values of zero may represent small values that round to zero.  The Excel version of this table provides additional precision which may be accessed by selecting individual cells.
NM = Not meaningful due to large relative standard error or excessive percentage change.
Notes: See Glossary for definitions. Values are preliminary. See Technical Notes for a discussion of the sample design for the Form EIA-923.
Negative generation denotes that electric power consumed for plant use exceeds gross generation.
Totals may not equal sum of components because of independent rounding. Percentage change is calculated before rounding.
